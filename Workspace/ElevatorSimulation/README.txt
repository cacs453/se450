Hi Professor,

The "src" folder contains all the java source files. You need to import them as a java project. We use Eclipse as the development IDE.
src/se450/elevator/ElevatorSystem.java is the entrance to run the simulation. You can change the parameters in src/se450/elevator/config/config.xml to modify the initial configuration.
src/JUnitTest folder contains all the JUNIT test cases.

The "doc" folder contains all the HTML documents generated by javadoc command. Please refer to these documents for our class implementation.

Thanks!
