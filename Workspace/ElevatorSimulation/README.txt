Hi Professor,

The "src" folder contains all the java source files. You need to import them as a java project.
src/se450/elevator/ElevatorSystem.java is the entrance to run the given sample for Phase II development.
src/JUnitTest folder contains all the JUNIT test cases. ElevatorImplTest.java is the most important one for Phase II.

The "doc" folder contains all the HTML documents generated by javadoc command. Please refer to these documents for our class implementation.

Thanks!
